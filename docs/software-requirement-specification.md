# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

*Project Name*: Team Management Web Application

## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the software requirements for the Team Management Web Application. This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, user interfaces, system interactions, and other necessary details needed for the successful development and deployment of the application.

### Scope
The Team Management Web Application is a comprehensive tool designed to facilitate team collaboration, task management, and progress tracking. Teams will be able to register, manage members, and track their progress on a centralized dashboard. The application will cater to small to medium-sized teams aiming to enhance communication, transparency, and project efficiency.

## System Overview

The system will consist of a React-based frontend that interfaces with a Node.js and Express backend. MongoDB will serve as the primary database.

## Functional Requirements

**User Registration and Authentication**
    - Users should be able to register an account using an email address and password.
    - Users should be able to log in using their credentials.
    - Passwords must be encrypted, and authentication should be secure.
    - Role-based access control (team member, leader) should be implemented.

**Team Creation and Management**
    - Registered users should be able to create new teams.
    - Team creators will have admin privileges, allowing them to add or remove team members.

**Posting Updates**
    - Registered users should be able to post their progress.

**Dashboard**
    - A centralized dashboard should display all the updates posted by the team members.


## Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance Requirements**
    - The system should support concurrent users and handle real-time updates without significant delays.
    - The system must be scalable to accommodate an increasing number of users, teams, and tasks.

**Security Requirements**
    - User data must be protected using encryption, especially during authentication and communication with the server.

**Usability Requirements**
    - The user interface must be intuitive, clean, and easy to navigate, following modern design principles.
