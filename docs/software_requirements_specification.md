# Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

*Project Name*: Team Management Web Application

## Introduction

### Purpose

The purpose of this document is to provide a detailed description of the software requirements for the Team Management Web Application. This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements, user interfaces, system interactions, and other necessary details needed for the successful development and deployment of the application.

### Scope
The Team Management Web Application is a comprehensive tool designed to facilitate team collaboration, task management, and progress tracking. Teams will be able to register, manage members, and track their progress on a centralized dashboard. The application will cater to small to medium-sized teams aiming to enhance communication, transparency, and project efficiency.
